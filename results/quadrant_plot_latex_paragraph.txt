In \Cref{fig:quadrant_comparison}, we examine the average performance of baseline and six different methods across three difficulty levels---Easy (Short Output, Low Dispersion), Medium (Short Output, High Dispersion), and Hard (Long Output, High Dispersion)---averaged across all models and context lengths from both HELMET (16K/32K) and LongProc (2K/5K) benchmarks. The baseline model exhibits natural performance degradation as task difficulty increases, declining 45.3\% from Easy to Medium tasks and an additional 23.9\% from Medium to Hard tasks, representing an overall 58.4\% drop across the difficulty spectrum. NF4 and Int8 demonstrate minimal performance degradation of -1.69\% ± 2.18\% and +0.48\% ± 1.41\% respectively, maintaining near-baseline performance across all difficulty levels. DuoAttention represents a notable exception among KV cache methods, achieving improved performance of +10.10\% ± 4.74\% across all difficulty levels, with particularly strong gains on Easy tasks (+18.6\%) that diminish but remain positive on Medium (+9.4\%) and Hard (+2.3\%) tasks. In contrast, token eviction methods (SnapKV, PyramidKV, StreamingLLM) show substantial performance degradation averaging -25.62\% ± 3.56\% across all difficulty levels. StreamingLLM exhibits the most severe degradation at -34.14\% ± 7.33\%, particularly struggling on Easy tasks (-48.5\%), while SnapKV and PyramidKV show more uniform degradation patterns at -19.24\% ± 4.47\% and -23.49\% ± 4.38\% respectively. Notably, token eviction methods exhibit substantial internal degradation as difficulty increases, with SnapKV and PyramidKV dropping 63.1\% and 63.1\% respectively from Easy to Hard tasks, exacerbating the 58.4\% baseline degradation. Thus, quantization methods maintain near-baseline performance with minimal variation across difficulty levels, DuoAttention consistently improves performance, while token eviction methods fail to achieve competitive performance across the difficulty spectrum.
