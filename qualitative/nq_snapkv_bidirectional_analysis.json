Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on compressibility.\n\nDocument (Title: Speed of sound): all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO which \"is\" a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at ultrasonic frequencies ().\nIn a dispersive medium, the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the dispersion relation.
