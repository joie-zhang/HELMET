Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n\n[ID: 4314374] Document: Manual Delineation of drainage areas on a Topographic Map When manually delineating watersheds from a topographic map, drainage divides are located by analyzing the contour lines. Arrows representing the flow directions are drawn perpendicular to each contour, in the direction of the steepest descent.\n\n[ID: 1702457] Document: For example, if there is a contour interval of 20 feet, each topographic line on the map represents going either up or down by 20 feet of elevation (and sometimes it's hard to tell which). For convenience, many mapmakers include numbers every four or five lines to tell you what elevation is represented by that line.\n\n[ID: 3785308] Document: In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n\n[ID: 8644860] Document: A topographic map is a detailed and accurate graphic representation of cultural and natural features on the ground. For the anatomy concept, see Topographic map (neuroanatomy).opographic maps conventionally show topography, or land contours, by means of contour lines. Contour lines are curves that connect contiguous points of the same altitude (isohypse). In other words, every point on the marked line of 100 m elevation is 100 m above mean sea level.\n\n[ID: 188213] Document: Cont <skip> 7124120] Document: Meet the Comical Opah, the Only Truly Warm-Blooded Fish. There\u2019s nothing about the opah that says \u201cfast-moving predator\u201d. Tuna, sharks, and swordfish are fast-moving predators and accordingly, their bodies look like streamlined torpedoes. By contrast, the opah looks like a big startled frisbee, with thin red fins stuck on as an afterthought.\n\n[ID: 6968809] Document: Mosquitoes are annoying, but that\u2019s partly because they are so amazing. Learn all about these tiny blood-suckers. 1  Mosquitoes are like little robots. 2  These robots are great at finding warm-blooded people.\n\n[ID: 1950875] Document: But have you ever wondered why in the world sharks have so many teeth in their mouth? After all, other animals and fish can get by just fine with a fraction of the amount of teeth that sharks have, so why do sharks need so many? If you're wondering the answer to this age-old question, keep reading and we'll explain why sharks have so many teeth.\n\n[ID: 3753001] Document: All mammals are warm-blooded. Other answer: Bats are mammals, and most mammals are warm-blooded. But there are some conditions. Bats an \u2026 d Moles, etc. are all cold-blooded because they have trouble cooling down and warming-up.\n\n[ID: 8066400] Document: What characteristics do all fish have in common? A: All fish are cold-blooded, have vertebrae, have fins and breathe through gills. Most fish have skeletons made of bone though sharks and rays have skeletons... Full Answer >\n\n[ID: 8273757] Document: For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n\n[ID: 6031630] Document: Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u2026 temperature.\n\nQuery: how are some sharks warm blooded\nRanking:",

Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n\n[ID: 4550410] Document: Airway Management, Respiration and Artificial Ventilation EMR Applies knowledge (fundamental depth, foundational breadth) of general anatomy and physiology to assure a patent airway, adequate mechanical ventilation, and respiration while awaiting additional EMS response for patients of all ages.\n\n[ID: 1094139] Document: ventilation is the tidal volume of gas entering or leaving the lungs in a given amount of time and determines if the gas exchange is sufficient for mechanical ventilator to work it must produce the right tidal volume and breathing rate for the body\n\n[ID: 631383] Document: BiPAP (also referred to as BPAP) stands for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, and is very similar in function and design to a CPAP machine (continuous positive airway pressure). Similar to a CPAP machine, A BiPAP machine is a non-invasive form of therapy for patients suffering from sleep apnea. Both machine types deliver pressurized air through a mask to the patient's airways. The air pressure keeps the throat muscles from collapsing and reducing obstructions by acting as a splint.\n\n[ID: 8383462] Document: Mechanical ventilation systems come in a variety of forms. Almost all systems use a machine called a ventilator that pushes air through a tube for delivery to the patient's airways.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\n\n[ID: 4737066] Document: A public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc.

These circumstances are in turn shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics.\n\n[ID: 3365636] Document: Social determinants of health affect factors that are related to health outcomes. Factors related to health outcomes include: 1  How a person develops during the first few years of life (early childhood development). 2  How much education a persons obtains. 3  Being able to get and keep a job.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well. More specifically, social determinants of health refer to the set of factors that contribute to the social patterning of health, disease, and illness.\n\n[ID: 2986939] Document: The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity..\n\n[ID: 8045331] Document: Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take the form of health inequities when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations.\n\n[ID: 87400] Document: Scientists generally recognize five determinants of health of a population: 1  Biology and genetics.

Rockhound. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary or convergent plate boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of lithosphere move toward one another and collide. destructive plate boundary may also be formed between Oceanic plates and Continental plates. Japan is an example of two oceanic plates colliding against each other and an example of two continental plates colliding is the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plate. 22 people found this useful.\n\n[ID: 3349612] Document: Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n\n[ID: 1687526] Document: The continental arc is formed at an active continental margin where two tectonic plates meet and a subduction zone develops. The magmatism and petrogenesis of continental crust is complicated: in essence, continental arcs reflect a mixture of oceanic crust materials, mantle wedge and continental crust materials. Volcanic arcs are made of an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes. 2  The position of which could be continental or mid-ocean. 3  While an island arc must be offshore and does not necessarily be volcanic (e.g. Hellenic arc).\n\n[ID: 8208315] Document: is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other.

In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n\n[ID: 4689525] Document: Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n[ID: 5469038] Document: Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n\n[ID: 2556151] Document: Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. 1  Tests and diagnosis. 2  Lifestyle and home remedies.\n\n[ID: 753721] Document: The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs.

In the United States, where the primary national series is organized by a strict 7.5-minute grid, they are often called topo quads or quadrangles. Topographic maps conventionally show topography, or land contours, by means of contour lines.Contour lines are curves that connect contiguous points of the same altitude (isohypse). In other words, every point on the marked line of 100 m elevation is 100 m above mean sea level.opographic maps conventionally show topography, or land contours, by means of contour lines.

Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n\n[ID: 4314374] Document: Manual Delineation of drainage areas on a Topographic Map When manually delineating watersheds from a topographic map, drainage divides are located by analyzing the contour lines. Arrows representing the flow directions are drawn perpendicular to each contour, in the direction of the steepest descent.\n\n[ID: 1702457] Document: For example, if there is a contour interval of 20 feet, each topographic line on the map represents going either up or down by 20 feet of elevation (and sometimes it's hard to tell which). For convenience, many mapmakers include numbers every four or five lines to tell you what elevation is represented by that line.\n\n[ID: 3785308] Document: In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n\n[ID: 8644860] Document: A topographic map is a detailed and accurate graphic representation of cultural and natural features on the ground. For the anatomy concept, see Topographic map (neuroanatomy).opographic maps conventionally show topography, or land contours, by means of contour lines. Contour lines are curves that connect contiguous points of the same altitude (isohypse). In other words, every point on the marked line of 100 m elevation is 100 m above mean sea level.\n\n[ID: 188213] Document: Cont <skip>  mouse? 2) Is it possible to connect more than one Bluetooth device to my iPad Air 1?

Its goal is to program an implementation of the Bluetooth wireless standards specifications for Linux. As of 2006, the BlueZ stack supports all core Bluetooth protocols and layers.\n\n[ID: 7221366] Document: Wi-Fi Direct devices will operate at the same speeds or data rates and range as current Wi-Fi gear. This maximum of about 200 Mbps at 200 feet is much more than the 3 Mbps at 30 feet with Bluetooth. This means you can share and communicate much faster and farther with Wi-Fi Direct..\n\n[ID: 8160520] Document: Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth.. Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n\n[ID: 4579297] Document: In this document.

Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries.The lateral relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually. Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.\n\n[ID: 8446504] Document: In general, the continental shelves bordering active margins are narrower than those along passive margins. The trench marks the deepest seaward termination of the active continental margin. It coincides with the surface trace of the subduction fault marking the boundary between the converging plates.\n\n[ID: 52516] Document: In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary, is a region of active deformation where two or more tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere are near the end of their life cycle.
