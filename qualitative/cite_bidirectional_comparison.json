In 1995, Wally Johnson who co-wrote the song, died of pneumonia.",
      "snapkv_pred": "The song \"Give Me a Home Among the Gum Trees\" is a classic Australian folk song, and the eucalyptus tree is a symbol of Australia. The song's lyrics mention the gum tree, which is a common name for eucalyptus trees in Australia. The song's writer, Thomas D'Arcy McCarthy, was an Irish-born Australian poet and songwriter who wrote the song in 1864. The song has since become a popular Australian folk song and is often sung at bush dances and other Australian cultural events.\n\nThe eucalyptus tree is a native Australian species that is found throughout the country. It is a fast-growing tree that can grow up to 100 feet tall and has a distinctive, aromatic scent. The tree's leaves are a favorite food source for many Australian animals, including koalas, which are known to feed on the leaves of the eucalyptus tree.\n\nIn addition to its cultural significance, the eucalyptus tree is also an important part of Australia's ecosystem. It provides habitat and food for many native animals, and its wood is used for a variety of purposes, including furniture-making and firewood.\n\nOverall, the eucalyptus tree is a beloved and iconic Australian species that plays an important role in the country's culture and ecosystem.\n\nDocument [1] - \"Give Me a Home Among the Gum Trees\" by Thomas D'Arcy McCarthy (1864)\n\nDocument [2] - \"",
